  Output: In this lesson, we'll get to know compound data structures in R: vectors, lists, matrices, arrays, and data frames.
    But first, let me say that there really is no difference in R between scalars and non-scalars: 
    All objects are in fact non-scalars.

  Output: For example, the number 122 is in fact just a vector of length 1, containing the number 1. 
    This is the reason you can not just type length(c(111,222,333)), but also length(111) ... do this now to see the output.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='length(111)')
  Hint: Just type length(111).
