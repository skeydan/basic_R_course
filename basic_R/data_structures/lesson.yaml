  Output: In this lesson, we'll get to know compound data structures in R: vectors, lists, matrices, arrays, and data frames.
    But first, let me say that there really is no difference in R between scalars and non-scalars: 
    All objects are in fact non-scalars.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For example, the number 122 is in fact just a vector of length 1, containing the number 1. 
    This is the reason you can not just type length(c(111,222,333)), but also length(111) ... do this now to see the output.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='length(111)')
  Hint: Just type length(111).

  Output: Data structures may be classified according to two main criteria: their dimensionality (1, 2, or n-dimensional) as well as
    the homogeneity or heterogeneity of objects they may contain.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Regarding dimensionality, vectors are one-dimensional, matrices are two-dimensional, and arrays are n-dimensional objects.
    All three have in common that they may only contain one type of object.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start with vectors. Vectors are created using c(). 
    Create a vector v1 containing the elements "alpha", "beta" and "gamma" (in this order).
  AnswerTests: omnitest(v1 <- c("alpha", "beta", "gamma"))
  Hint: Just type v1 <- c("alpha", "beta", "gamma").    
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Next, create a vector v2 containing the numbers from 33 to 35.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('v2 <- c(33,34,35)')
  Hint: Just type v2 <- c(33,34,35).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, concatenate both vectors and call the result v3.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('v3 <- c(v1,v2)')
  Hint: Just type v3 <- c(v1,v2).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As you see, the result is not a nested vector, but has been flattened. Vectors cannot contain other vectors.
    Now, given that we've concatenated two different data types, what type will the resulting vector have?
    As we said vectors always have to be of a single data type only.
    Go ahead and check (you could use typeof() to get the internal data type, is.numeric() to check for numerical data,
    or is.character to test for character data.)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('typeof(v3)', 'is.character(v3)', 'is.numeric(v3)')
  Hint: Just type typeof(v3).
