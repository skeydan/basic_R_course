#1
- Class: text
  Output: Now that we've covered compound data structures, we need to know how to access items (or subsets) of these structures.
   
#2
- Class: text
  Output: Again, we'll start with the vector.
  
#3
- Class: text
  Output: You can access specific items using brackets. Inside the brackets, a vector(!) of indices tells R which elements you want to get outer(
     Indexing starts at 1
    
#4
- Class: text
  Output: Indexing starts at 1. To access the first item, type myvector[1].
    
#5
- Class: text
  Output: To access elements 1 to 5 (that is, consecutive elements), type myvector[1:5].  
  
#6
- Class: text
  Output: To access elements 1 and 5 (which aren't consecutive), type myvector[c(1,5)]. 
 
#7
- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  Create a vector of numbers from 10 to 20 and assign it to myvector.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('myvector <- 10:20')
  Hint: Just type myvector <- 10:20.
  
#8
- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  Now, extract the last two elements from this vector.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 19:20')
  Hint: Just type myvector[10:11].
  
#9
- Class: text
  Output:  You can also use the minus sign to indicate which elements you don't want. For example, to see all but the first element, you'd type myvector[-1].
  
#10
- Class: text
  Output: Let's move on to subsetting lists now.
