- Class: text
  Output: As an introduction to doing data science with R, we'll have a quick look at linear regression.

- Class: text
  Output: You'll see that using R for statistics, data science, machine learning etc. is incredibly comfortable.
    Often, you just need one or two lines of code.

  Output: Let's jump right in! Say you were given the average brain and body weights for different species of mammals.
    In fact, you're really being given these data now - we've loaded the "mammals" dataset from the MASS library for you.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As usual, use head() on the dataset to inspect it.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("head(mammals)")
  Hint: Just type head(mammals). 

#35
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Do you think there is a relationship between body weight and brain weight?
    Why not first plot the data? (ggplot2 has already been loaded.)
  AnswerTests: omnitest("ggplot(data = mammals, mapping = aes(x = body, y = brain)) + geom_point()")
  Hint: Just type ggplot(data = mammals, mapping = aes(x = body, y = brain)) + geom_point(). 
  
#35
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can also check the correlation between brain and body. (Call cor() on the dataset.)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("cor(mammals)", "cor(mammals$body, mammals$brain)")
  Hint: Just type cor(mammals).

  Output: By now you probably think that there's a pretty strong relationship between body weight and brain weight.
