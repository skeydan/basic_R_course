  Output: Hi and welcome to the Trivadis "Dive into R" course! I'm looking forward to showing you how to do stuff with R.
    When scrolling through text, just type "enter" to continue...
    
- Class: text
  Output: 
    ... exactly.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now just type 2 into the console to see how R evaluates the input and outputs the result.
  CorrectAnswer: 2 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2')
  Hint: Just type 2.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Numbers are self-evaluating so R just returns the input. 
    Now type sin(1) + cos(0) + 23/24 to see R calculating a numerical result.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sin(1) + cos(0) + 23/24')
  Hint: Just type sin(1) + cos(0) + 23/24.

- Class: text
  Output: Numbers in R are double precision by default, so there is no difference between say 2.0 and 2.
    If you explicitly need an integer, you have to write 2L.
          
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Strings (or characters) in R may be enclosed by either single or double quotes.
    Try outputting the string "R you ready?" now.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('"R you ready?"', '\'R you ready?\'')
  Hint: Just type one of "R you ready?" or 'R you ready?'.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now output the same string again, but if you used double quotes before, use single quotes now, and vice versa.
    You'll notice that in both cases, R prints the string using double quotes. This is because the quotes are not part
    of the internal representation. How R prints an object on the console is determined by the object itself - - it may,
    for example, include pretty-printing.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('"R you ready?"', '\'R you ready?\'')
  Hint: Just type one of "R you ready?" or 'R you ready?'.   
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Besides strings and numbers, another indispensable object type is "logical" - True or False.
    On the console, test if TRUE equals FALSE, using double equality signs for the test.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('TRUE == FALSE', 'FALSE == TRUE')
  Hint: Just type one of 'TRUE == FALSE' or 'FALSE == TRUE'.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Languages differ in if and how they coerce non-boolean object types to booleans. Use isTRUE to check
   whether in R, the number 1 is TRUE.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('isTRUE(1)')
  Hint: Just type isTRUE(1).   
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If you want to coerce another object type to a logical, you need to explicitly use as.logical. 
    Try coercing the character string 'true' to a logical and see what happens.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('as.logical("true")')
  Hint: Just type as.logical("true").       

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that we've seen the most important basic object types, let's talk about assignment.
    Assignment in R is done using the <- operator or alternatively, the equality sign.
    To try this, assign y the value 299.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('y <- 299', 'y = 299')
  Hint: Just type y <- 299.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now test if y equals -10.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('y == -10')
  Hint: Just type y == -10.  
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now that we've seen the basic R object types, let's look at some special features.
    One is that every object can have attributes - metadata, so to say.
    This will be most useful with the data structures we'll see in the next lesson (e.g., lists or data frames),
    but even objects like numbers can have attributes!
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To check if an object has attributes, you use the attributes() function.
    To try this out, first create a variable called named_int and assign it the value 25.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('named_int <- 25', 'named_int = 25')
  Hint: Just type named_int <- 25. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, check whether named_int has any attributes.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('attributes(named_int)')
  Hint: Just type attributes(named_int).   
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use the function attr() to set named_int's my_name attribute to Rose. 
    The syntax is attr(<var>, <name>) <- <value>.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("attr(named_int, 'my_name') <-'Rose'")
  Hint: Just type attr(named_int, 'my_name') <-'Rose'.   
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: And now, check again if named_int has attributes.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("attributes(named_int)")
  Hint: Just type attributes(named_int).  
  
- Class: text
  Output: Another thing that is special in R is factors.
    Factors are used for categorical data.Imagine you have data where the numbers 1,2,3,4 are used to describe three different treatments,
    for example, three different sleeping pills. If you don't do anything, R will treat these numbers as ordered and metric,
    meaning that 4 is bigger than - and even twice as big as - 2. This leads to wrong results in many statistical methods.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Therefore, what you do is convert the variable to a factor. We haven't seen vectors yet (
    this is the topic of the next lesson) but a vector is just a concatenation of elements of a common type.
    Vectors are created using the c() function. So, please create a variable a that will hold our sleeping pills.
    Type a <- c(2,4,3,3,1,1,1,1,4) to create the vector.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("a <- c(2,4,3,3,1,1,1,1,4)")
  Hint: Just type a <- c(2,4,3,3,1,1,1,1,4).     
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, display the contents of a.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("a")
  Hint: Just type a.  
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Converting a variable to a factor is done using factor(). Now, create a factor a_f from a.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("a_f <- factor(a)")
  Hint: Just type a_f <- factor(a).  
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, display a_f and look at the output.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("a_f")
  Hint: Just type a_f.  
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Levels are realized as attributes.To wrap up this lesson, inspect the attributes of the newly created a_f variable.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("attributes(a_f)")
  Hint: Just type attributes(a_f).  
  
- Class: text
  Output: Congratulations! You've reached the end of the first lesson.
    Next, we'll dig deeper into things like vectors, lists, matrices and data frames.
